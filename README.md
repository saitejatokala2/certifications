Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH) - Research and Learnings
Overview
I am a Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH) certified by the EC-Council, equipped with the knowledge and skills to identify, analyze, and mitigate cybersecurity threats. Through this certification, I have gained a deep understanding of ethical hacking methodologies, tools, and techniques to secure systems and networks from malicious attacks. As part of my journey, I conducted research on web application attacks, exploring their mechanisms, impacts, and mitigation strategies. This README file outlines my learnings, research contributions, and the key takeaways from my certification and research work.

# Research Paper: Web Application Attacks and Mitigation Strategies

As part of my research, I explored the growing threats to web applications and proposed effective mitigation strategies. Below is a summary of my research contributions:

### 1. Common Web Application Attacks

SQL Injection: Exploiting database vulnerabilities to access or manipulate sensitive data.

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Injecting malicious scripts into web pages viewed by users.

Denial of Service (DoS): Overloading a system to make it unavailable to users.

Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS): Coordinated DoS attacks from multiple sources to overwhelm a system.

### 2. Impact of Web Application Attacks

Unauthorized access to sensitive data (e.g., user credentials, financial information).

Compromised user privacy and trust.

Financial losses and reputational damage to organizations.

### 3. Mitigation Strategies

Secure Coding Practices: Implementing input validation, output encoding, and parameterized queries.

Regular Vulnerability Assessments: Conducting penetration testing and code reviews.

Web Application Firewalls (WAFs): Deploying WAFs to filter and monitor HTTP traffic.

Encryption: Using HTTPS and strong encryption algorithms to protect data in transit.

Security Headers: Implementing headers like Content Security Policy (CSP) and X-Frame-Options.

### 4. Tools for Web Application Security

OWASP ZAP: For identifying vulnerabilities in web applications.

Burp Suite: For penetration testing and vulnerability scanning.

Nikto: For scanning web servers for misconfigurations and vulnerabilities.

SQLMap: For detecting and exploiting SQL injection vulnerabilities.

### 5. Organizational Security Measures

Conducting regular employee training on cybersecurity best practices.

Implementing a robust incident response plan.

Ensuring compliance with data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).
